                <h1>DNDNext Wordpress Site</h1>
                <p>This project was made for a wordpress class. We ended up making out own wordpress theme with out own style for the website. I choose to make a website centered around
                    D&D and the related subject. Everything on it it is 5th edition related and is intended to follow official modules, homebrew content, and my own current campagin.
                    It showcases the effect that went into the theme and includeds a few add-ons as well on the site. Shows the graphic fedility of what wordpress is capable off.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Lots of different styling and effort went into making this site look and feel the way it does. Not only is coding a factor, but making sure that the site looks good visual
                   and structurally. It uses the best web design pratices to make sure that the site is accessible to all. To make sure that it makes use of appropriate white space.
                   Making sure that the site is responsive for mobile devices.
